Yet just as noteworthy as the posts themselves are the responses of Confessions’ followers, ranging from simple likes to direct offers of academic<a href="https://www.facebook.com/columbiaconfessionz/posts/365042064844747"> and emotional support</a>. Even as the on-campus community was disrupted by <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/10/05/post-virtual-learning-in-a-covid-19-world-students-thoughts-on-the-return-to-campus/">18 months of virtual learning</a> during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Columbia Confessions remained active. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Beyond providing a platform for Columbia students to relieve stress and anxiety in the short term, how does Confessions function as a community of its own? How do students use Confessions to find community beyond virtual spaces? And how do the page’s over 6,500 followers engage with topics of mental health, especially loneliness and isolation? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> To answer these questions, Spectator analyzed around 2,000 confessions made since mid-March 2021 and interviewed some of the most active students on Confessions. Here are their stories of finding community. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> ~~~~~~ </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As of 2016, there were <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05193">almost 200 </a>Facebook confessions pages for colleges and universities around the country. Columbia Confessions follows a format typical for many of them. Anyone can submit a confession anonymously through a <a href="https://forms.gle/rRr8rjajS1kunWyi6">Google Form</a>. The page administrators then choose which confessions to post. Sometimes confessions on similar topics come out in batches; other times, confessions are released on their own. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Confessions did not arise out of a vacuum. Its forerunners include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/columbia.compliments">Columbia Compliments</a>, which allowed students to send <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/2012/11/15/compliments-flood-new-facebook-page/">anonymous positive messages</a> to other students, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/columbiaclassconfessions/">Columbia University Class Confessions</a>, a platform similar to today’s Columbia Confessions, created specifically to <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2015/04/09/columbia-class-confessions-opens-dialogue-about-first-generation-and-low-income-0/">address the experiences</a> of first-generation and low-income students. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> What distinguishes Columbia Confessions from its predecessors is its broader subject matter and audience. While University Class Confessions was centered on the identities and experiences of first-generation, low-income students, Columbia Confessions was founded as an all-purpose campus forum. Unlike Columbia Compliments, which focused on amplifying positive messages, Columbia Confessions often serves as a space for students to acknowledge, express, and find support when faced with negative emotions and experiences, such as struggles with mental health. And while its predecessors seem to have gone dormant, Confessions continues to post almost every day. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> ~~~~~~ </p> <div class="graphic"> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The result is a continuous feed of students’ thoughts, hopes, and anxieties from all corners of the University. To track the patterns of the Confessions community over the past year of pandemic-related social isolation and upheaval, we scraped Confessions posts from the beginning of the fall 2019 semester to mid-November 2021 directly from Facebook. Each confession was given a sentiment score between -1 (most negative) and 1 (most positive) using the <a href="https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment">vaderSentiment</a> open source library. We limited our analysis to posts from March 19, 2021 through November 4, 2021, classifying posts as negative, neutral, or positive based on their sentiment scores. We then read each negative-sentiment post, manually tagging the ones related to loneliness, isolation, or a general need for community support. We compared the engagement on these posts, as measured by comments, shares, and reactions, to engagement on neutral- and positive-sentiment posts. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> A few results stood out. As might be expected, confessions which we had identified as loneliness or isolation-related had more negative sentiment scores on average than those of typical confessions, or even typical negative sentiment confessions. In addition, the median sentiment score was 0.10 for all confessions since mid-March 2021, -0.64 for all negative-sentiment confessions, and -0.79 for confessions about loneliness or isolation. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Confessions’ audience also seemed to respond more strongly to such posts, using the “care” reaction much more frequently on average for loneliness or isolation-related posts, and the “haha” reaction much less frequently than for any other class of posts. </p> <div class="graphic">   <style media="screen,print">#g-cares-box,#g-cares-box .g-artboard{margin:0

In addition, 66 percent of posts had at least one comment from someone who does not regularly comment on posts. </p> </div> </div> </div>  </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Those care reactions and comments also seem to translate into genuine relationships. After identifying top commenters in the Confessions community from our scraped data, we interviewed several who told us that their engagement with anonymous posters through Confessions has led to longer-lasting in-person connections. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> When Zoe Elison, SEAS ’23, noticed that many students were having trouble forming meaningful connections during the pandemic, she decided to create Facebook groups to make people feel more supported. Most recently, she has created <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277986567320729/">neurodivergent @ columbia</a>, a group for neurodivergent people to connect with each other. Elison sees Confessions as a space where people “can branch off into more niche communities,” like those she has been trying to cultivate. Elison also noted that the anonymity provided by Confessions can make it easier for students to voice mental health concerns, especially in a society that stigmatizes seeking support for mental health. “I will comment on posts and be like, ‘Hey, feel free to reach out to me,’ and people will be like, ‘Oh, I was the one who made that post, and I didn’t want my friends to know what I was going through.’” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> ~~~~~~ </p> <div class="graphic"> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> John Gonzaga, GS ’20, also became more involved with online community-building during the pandemic, taking initiative by organizing social events over Zoom and in person with people he met through Confessions. He found the page to be a source of comfort while he was working in the highly stressful environment of a hospital during the height of the pandemic: “Even if I wasn’t saying anything, seeing other people and their outpouring of support—that’s one of the little things that shook me up and made me feel better, made me feel less lousy, like people wanted to take care of each other.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While the Confessions community members we interviewed all emphasized the positive aspects of mutual support and validation that the page provides, we also asked if they had any concerns about potentially triggering content being posted on the page, especially given the sensitive content of many mental health-related posts, such as suicidal thoughts. Furthermore, we asked what it might say about Columbia’s formal systems of support for students’ mental health, when so many students find themselves resorting to Confessions for help. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Like Gonzaga, Alison Kitchkommie, GS ’23, another frequent commenter, has formed significant connections that started as interactions on Confessions, and like Elison, she has tried using the page as a place to gather momentum around students’ shared identities and struggles, such as attempting to organize <a href="https://www.facebook.com/columbiaconfessionz/posts/596726315009653">self-advocacy for students with disabilities</a>. Although she does not feel burdened by reading negative posts or reaching out to isolated individuals, Kitchkommie acknowledged that for others, reading such content might “just amplif[y] the negative feelings that you already have.” She also sees the patterns of posting on Confessions as an indicator of systemic issues within the University’s mental health infrastructure: “When you seem to have all of these separate instances of people saying, ‘I am not supported on campus,’ ‘I am struggling,’ or ‘I’m trying to get into [care for] mental health, and they can’t see me for X number of weeks.’ … I think it is a reflection of how well people are being supported generally on campus.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Stan Liao, SEAS ’21, who co-founded Confessions with friends in 2019 and stepped away from his administrative role after graduating, said it was never the co-founders’ intention for Confessions to replace formal systems of mental health support on campus: “I really hope we haven’t supplanted CPS,” Liao said. “I hope we [act as] an accessory and even help formal mental health systems.” He characterized Confessions as “a place where people [could] scream their inane, or deeply personal, or funny thoughts into the void.” However, Liao and his fellow administrators took care not to let that void be filled with just any content. For instance, in deciding how to treat posts related to suicide and other struggles with mental health, they consulted a psychology professor. Currently, Confessions administrators preface posts referencing suicide and other forms of self-harm with trigger warnings. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While he acknowledged concerns about the possible negative effect on some students of being exposed to such content, Liao also echoed a sentiment shared by the Confessions commenters we interviewed: “Just knowing that other people are going through the same thing helps.” In addition, like Elison, he noted the potential for anonymous confessions to act as a first step for those seeking help for mental health struggles. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> When asked to reflect on how Confessions has developed since its founding, Liao said, “I didn’t really have an intent for where it would take us. It felt like most college confessions pages end up probably similar to ours. There’s a mixture of shitposting, and people do genuinely, occasionally find something valuable out of it.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Graphics reporter Eleanor Lin can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:eleanor.lin@columbiaspectator.com"><i>eleanor.lin@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.</i><i> </i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Graphics editor Jessica Li can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:jessica.li@columbiaspectator.com"><i>jessica.li@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>. </i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Data scraped from Columbia Confessions by Newsroom Development.
