Elison also notes how the anonymity provided by Confessions can make it easier for students to voice mental health concerns, especially in a society that stigmatizes seeking support for mental health. “I will comment on posts and be like, ‘Hey, feel free to reach out to me,’ and people will be like, ‘Oh, I was the one who made that post.

Although she does not feel burdened by reading negative posts, even reaching out to isolated individuals, Kitchkommie acknowledges that for others, reading such content might “ just amplif[y] the negative feelings that you already have.” She also sees the patterns of posting on Confessions as an indicator of systemic issues within the University’s mental health infrastructure: “When you seem to have all of these separate instances of people saying, ‘I am not supported on campus,’ ‘I am struggling,’ or ‘I'm trying to get into [care for] mental health, and they can't see me for X number of weeks’ . . .

For instance, in deciding how to treat posts related to suicide and other struggles with mental health, they consulted a psychology professor. (Currently, Confessions prefaces confessions containing references to suicide and other forms of self-harm with trigger warnings.) While he acknowledged concerns about the possible negative effect on some students of being exposed to such content, Liao also echoed a sentiment shared by the Confessions commenters we interviewed: “Just knowing that other people are going through the same thing helps.” In addition, like Elison, he noted the potential for anonymous confessions to act as a first step for those seeking help for mental health struggles."
