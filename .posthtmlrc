Each confession was given a sentiment score between -1 (most negative) and 1 (most positive) using the <a href=\"https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment\">vaderSentiment</a> open source library. We limited our analysis to posts from March 19, 2021 through November 4, 2021, classifying posts as negative, neutral, or positive based on their sentiment scores. We then read each negative-sentiment post, manually tagging the ones related to loneliness, isolation, or a general need for community support. We compared the engagement on these posts, as measured by comments, shares, and reactions, to engagement on neutral- and positive-sentiment posts."

Elison also noted that the anonymity provided by Confessions can make it easier for students to voice mental health concerns, especially in a society that stigmatizes seeking support for mental health. “I will comment on posts and be like, ‘Hey, feel free to reach out to me,’ and people will be like, ‘Oh, I was the one who made that post, and I didn’t want my friends to know what I was going through.’”"

Although she does not feel burdened by reading negative posts or reaching out to isolated individuals, Kitchkommie acknowledged that for others, reading such content might “just amplif[y] the negative feelings that you already have.” She also sees the patterns of posting on Confessions as an indicator of systemic issues within the University’s mental health infrastructure: “When you seem to have all of these separate instances of people saying, ‘I am not supported on campus,’ ‘I am struggling,’ or ‘I’m trying to get into [care for] mental health, and they can’t see me for X number of weeks.’ … I think it is a reflection of how well people are being supported generally on campus.”"
