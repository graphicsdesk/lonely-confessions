We limited our analysis to begin in mid-March of 2021, splitting posts into negative, neutral, and positive-sentiment classes based on their scores. We then read each negative-sentiment post, manually tagging the ones related to loneliness, isolation, or a general need for community support. We compared the engagement on these posts, as measured by comments, shares, and reactions, to engagement on neutral and positive-sentiment posts."

Elison also notes how the anonymity provided by Confessions can make it easier for students to voice mental health concerns, especially in a society that stigmatizes seeking support for mental health. “I will comment on posts and be like, ‘Hey, feel free to reach out to me,’ and people will be like, ‘Oh, I was the one who made that post. And I didn’t want my friends to know what I was going through.’”"

Although she does not feel burdened by reading negative posts, even reaching out to isolated individuals, Kitchkommie acknowledges that for others, reading such content might “just amplif[y] the negative feelings that you already have.” She also sees the patterns of posting on Confessions as an indicator of systemic issues within the University’s mental health infrastructure: “When you seem to have all of these separate instances of people saying, ‘I am not supported on campus,’ ‘I am struggling,’ or ‘I’m trying to get into [care for] mental health, and they can’t see me for X number of weeks’ ... I think it is a reflection of how well people are being supported generally on campus.”"

For instance, in deciding how to treat posts related to suicide and other struggles with mental health, they consulted a psychology professor. Currently, Confessions prefaces confessions containing references to suicide and other forms of self-harm with trigger warnings. While he acknowledged concerns about the possible negative effect on some students of being exposed to such content, Liao also echoed a sentiment shared by the Confessions commenters we interviewed: “Just knowing that other people are going through the same thing helps.” In addition, like Elison, he noted the potential for anonymous confessions to act as a first step for those seeking help for mental health struggles."
